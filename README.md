### **Why I Built This App**

When my son started receiving weekly pocket money, I saw the perfect opportunity to teach him how to manage his finances. However, after testing numerous apps, I couldnâ€™t find one that was:

- Lightweight and simple to use.

- Visually appealing for cool kids.

- Fun and engaging, making learning enjoyable.

- Educational, with built-in head-calculation training to sharpen his math skills.

- Free

So, I decided to create this app myself.
